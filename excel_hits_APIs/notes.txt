according to chatgpt, excel can hit an API

consider this:
have a simple app on render that gives an API
that when hit returns the processed PDF zip
excel can hit this api and save the resulting pdf
it should be able to both find the pdf on the machine
and save it result


more general:
hit the api with the data (eg: pdf) as well as code
run the code against the data and return the result
this way, Dad would have a string containing the code
inside of excel and he could write it as needed
then hit the api
